# How to plot the field in VTK

1. Open ParaView and load the group of files marked by timestamps. Grouping should be done automatically by the file viewer, and if it is not, try exiting and entering the folder again to reindex. 
2. Press `⌃Space` or open the search bar and type `Plane`. This will add a plane to the scene to use it a seed for the streamlines.  
Plane in the case of this neuron should be with origin at (x, y, z) = (-200, -300, 60), point 1 at (-200, 600, 60) and point 2 at (200, -300, 60). Resolution set to X = 10 and Y = 5, it gives a square grid more or less. 
3. Click on the imported `.vtk` file in the pipeline browser, so that appropriate filters become availabale. Create `StreamTracesWithCustomSource` and choose the seed source created above and the input marked by the imported `.vtk` file. 
4. Create Tube filter: that will create tubes with a finite diameter instead of the lines generated by the `StreamTracer…`. 

Now we will import also the neuron shape to show alongside the field. Next we will want to color the neuron shape by the voltage at each point.

5. To export neuron tubes, we use the `tube` variable here in the notebook, defined in the section “3D visualization of a neuron”. To save it as a `vtk`, we use `tube.save("neuron_tubes.vtk")`. It exports also diameters of the tubes as a scalar field. 

6. To export voltages with neuron tubes together, we need to create an appropriate `.ex2` file.
