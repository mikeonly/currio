To test spacial resolution:

#+begin_src python
for sec in h.allsec():
    sec.nseg *= 3
#+end_src

and repeat the simulation.

*3 multiplication to split a segment leaving the central points at the same physical location. Then simulations are comparable with each other.

d_lambda rule: each segment is such that no peace is no longer than 0.1 of lambda (AC wavelength) at 100 Hz.

sealed end effect, downstream load or reflection
