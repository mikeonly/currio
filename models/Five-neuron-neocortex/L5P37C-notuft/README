This model neuron was derived from the L5P cell by cutting
the tufted ends of its main apical dendrite, and adapting
some dendritic channels. The neuron type is represented by
the blue and green neurons in the figures of the paper.

This dir is self-contained.

See the README of ../L5P37C for more documentation.

To simulate the neuron, please type (from within this dir)
