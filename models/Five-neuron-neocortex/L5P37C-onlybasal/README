This is a synthetic cell, primarily built to generate spikes 
different from those of L5P cells (in particular narrower spikes). 
The cell is incorporated as local interneuron in the network
(the red and yellow neurons in the figures of the paper).

I took the L5P cell, deleted all but the basal dendritic tree, 
rotated the cell, and used as channels those from the cerebellar
granule cell (and Golgi cell) model.

So most of this dir is self-contained (copied from ../L5P37C),
except for the channels, which have been borrowed from
../granule_cell.

For more documentation, please see he paper and the README file
of ../L5P37C.

To simulate this neuron, please type (from within this dir)
