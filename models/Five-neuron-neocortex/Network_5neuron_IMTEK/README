This is the code for running a 5-neuron network.
The network can be run by typing genesis Network.g.
To simulate the network without electrodes but with 
graphics, please type genesis Network_withoutElectrodes.g.
To simulate the network without graphics but with
electrodes, please type genesis Network_withoutGraphics.g.

It should be easy to run the network with fewer neurons
(uncomment respective lines) or more neurons (copy respective
lines and assign new neuron name and coordinates, also provide
new connections to electrodes, new input from fibres, etc).

Take into account that a 5-neuron network already runs extremely 
slowly, mainly due to the calculation and saving of the LFPs.
