This dir deals with graphical or file output.

L5P_history.g can be used to save spike times (of neurons
or fibres) to a file.

L5P_ascout.g is commonly used to write time series (of
membrane potential, electrode LFP, etc) to a file.

L5P_view.g will open a window picturing all the neurons' 
compartments, colour-coded by membrane potential and 
updated every 50 ms.

Likewise, L5P_graphsolve.g will open a window with online
graphs of the time-evolution of the membrane potential of
selected compartments. Note that L5P_graphsolve.g replaces
L5P_graph.g because of an unsolved problem with Genesis or
my code. The original code of L5P_graph.g intended to establish 
the messages from compartments to graphs before setting up 
the hinessolver. Unfortunately this resulted in a bus error. 
So L5P_graphsolve.g now makes these messages directly from 
the hinesolver element to the graphs, after creation of the 
hinessolver element.
